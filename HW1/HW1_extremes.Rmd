## Extreme metrics: number of freezing days

Freezing days are defined as the number of days (per year) with minimum temperatures below freezing (32 degrees F)

```{r}
# assign a new field to the climate table called "freeze" using an `ifelse` statement

sequoia_clim$freeze <- ifelse(sequoia_clim$tmin <= 32, 1, 0) # if yes, value of 1, if no, value of 0

# group data by year and put into a new dataframe
sequoia_freeze = sequoia_clim %>% 
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(date)) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(n_freeze =sum(freeze)) %>%
  drop_na()  

sequoia_freeze$dt = unique(year) #unsure what to do about this, was in sam's code

# plot the number of freezing days between 1927 and 2020
ggplot(data = sequoia_freeze, aes(x = year, y = n_freeze)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Number of Freezing Days") 

```

## Extreme metrics: hottest day of the year
```{r}
# group data by year and put into a new dataframe
sequoia_peak <- sequoia_clim %>% 
  mutate(year = lubridate::year(date)) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarize(hottest_day = max(tmax)) %>%
  drop_na()  

# plot the hottest day of the year  between 1927 and 2020
ggplot(data = sequoia_peak, aes(x = year, y = hottest_day)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Temperature of Hottest Day of the Year")  #
```

## Extreme metrics: (something with precipitation/ drought?)
```{r}
# return period

# assign a new field to the climate table called "flood" using an `ifelse` statement
sequoia_clim$flood <- ifelse(sequoia_clim$prcp >= 1, 1, 0) %>% 

   
unique(sequoia_clim$flood)
```
